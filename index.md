## Welcome to Blockchain-Security-for-cloud
In the internet world demand for data is increasing day by day. This has generated an issue of large data storage. To overcome this, cloud-based storage service was developed. Today there is vast involvement of cloud on business transaction and daily applications. This has raised the need for providing high end of security to the stored data, project helps to overcome this problem. The use of blockchain network as an interface to access the data which helps to overcome the problem of security of data on the cloud. The blockchain is a distributed public ledger and Internet-based computer network. This project works on the ERP data of a company, on a private cloud which is accessible through internet from any place. This system validates and secure the employee data of company. Smart phone and laptop security features like bio-metrics and password validation, can be to make this idea more robust and easier to use for end user. The local validation process of laptop and smart phones, acts as a user interface between the background process and the user. This also act as the next level of security for validation of user details. Thus, providing a more secure way of accessing the cloud service.

### MOTIVATION
Recent years have witnessed the trend of increasingly relying on distributed infrastructures. This increased the number of reported incidents of security breaches compromising user’s privacy, where third parties massively collect, process and manage user’s personal data. The use of blockchain network as an interface to access the data can help to overcome the problem of security of data on the cloud. The blockchain is a distributed public ledger. Every computer on it is called a node and has to record every verified transaction or contract. Since there are many nodes in such a network, and every node has an entire record of all transactions constituting a blockchain, it is not possible to alter data on the network level, as it is required to do so, virtually on all nodes. Smart phone and laptop security features like bio-metrics and password validation, has helped to make this idea more robust and easier to use for end user. The local validation process of laptop and smart phones, acts as a user interface between the background process and the user. This also act as the next level of security for validation of user details. Thus, providing a more secure way of accessing the cloud service.
### PROBLEM DEFINITION
To provides high end security to the data on the cloud, which is accessible to the user through an easy interface.
