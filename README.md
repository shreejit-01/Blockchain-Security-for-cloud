# Project Limitation and Scope
# 1.Project Scope
• The proposed system can support Multi-objective i.e the system can be implemented on any device or data.
• Detection of alteration of data on cloud. Due to use of blockchain the data
stored on cloud gets highly secured and any miscellaneous activity to alter the
data will be detected and stopped and the data will return to the previous state.
• Provide high end of security to the stored data.This allows the user to save data
on cloud without any worries.
# 2.Limitation
• This System system as of now works only on the Windows OS and Andriod
only.
• System could not work without internet connection, the continuous good speed
network is essential need of network.
• System attempts trillions of solutions per second in effort to validate transaction, so accuracy matters.
